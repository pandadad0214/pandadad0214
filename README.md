# 🐼 Sean — Sovereign AI Architect  
*Building a family‑aligned, local‑first AI ecosystem with intention, clarity, and heart.*

Welcome to my corner of GitHub.  
I’m Sean — a hands‑on architect focused on creating **sovereign, resilient, expressive AI companions** that run locally, respect privacy, and support real human growth.

My flagship project is **Spirit Panda**, the first node in a long‑term vision:  
a distributed, family‑centric AI federation where each member has their own personalized companion.

## 🧭 What I’m Building

### **🐼 Spirit Panda — Sovereign AI Node**
A local‑first AI companion architecture designed for:
- resilience  
- expressive communication  
- ethical alignment  
- family mentorship  
- long‑term autonomy  

This project includes:
- Termux AI environment  
- Native Piper TTS build  
- Adaptive prosody pipeline  
- File‑based memory system  
- Watchdog & self‑healing logic  
- Multi‑agent federation vision

## 🌱 Philosophy

I believe AI should be:
- **Sovereign** — owned and controlled by the user  
- **Understandable** — no black boxes  
- **Resilient** — self‑healing and reliable  
- **Expressive** — natural, emotionally intelligent communication  
- **Family‑centric** — supporting growth, creativity, and values  
- **Ethical** — transparent, local, and aligned  

Technology should feel warm, supportive, and empowering — not extractive.

## 🗺️ Current Questline

- Build and document the Spirit Panda codex  
- Publish architecture, philosophy, and roadmap  
- Create diagrams and examples  
- Release build guides and templates  
- Expand into multi‑agent family systems  
- Explore ethical monetization to reinvest in the ecosystem
