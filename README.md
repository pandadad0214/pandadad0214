# 🐼 Sean — Architect of the Panda Federation  
### Sovereign AI • Local‑First Systems • Family‑Driven Automation

Welcome to my corner of GitHub.  
I build **sovereign, local‑first AI agents** designed to support workflow, family, and long‑term legacy.  
Everything here is crafted with clarity, resilience, and ethical autonomy in mind.

## 🧬 The Panda Federation  
A multi‑agent AI ecosystem built around identity, lore, and purpose.

### 🐼 **Spirit Panda** — Sovereign AI Companion  
The primary node.  
A personalized, local‑first AI with memory, prosody, resilience, and a full identity system.

## 🎨 Identity & Lore  
The Panda theme began 18 years ago in **Jade Dynasty**, where my wife and I met (AZ ↔ TX).  
Our kids later joined the same world, and the Panda lineage became a family symbol.

I also go by **Samurai Panda** in Warzone — which inspired the sworded crest variant.

The Federation now carries that legacy forward into open‑source AI.
